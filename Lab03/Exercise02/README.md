# Przychodnia Marzeń:

The purpose of this exercise was to create the structure of a clinic website named "Przychodnia Marzeń" It includes sections for displaying the clinic's mission, available medical tests, and a form for scheduling appointments. Additionally, it showcases profiles of several doctors.

The form for scheduling appointments includes input fields for selecting a doctor, choosing a date, entering a phone number, and opting for SMS reminders. The form submission button has a light gray background with black text, creating a subtle appearance.
